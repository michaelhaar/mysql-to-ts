## About

`type-safe-sql-query` provides two well-tested util types

- `InferReturnTypeFromSqlStatement`
- `InferParamsTypeFromSqlStatement`

that allow us to automatically infer the return type and the parameter type of a SQL statement. e.g.:

```ts
type T0 = InferReturnTypeFromSqlStatement<"SELECT * FROM users", Tables>;
// => { id: number, name: string, age: number, email: string }[]
```

Feel free to be creative and use them however you like.

## Roadmap / Current Status

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that this project is in a very early stage and is not yet ready for production use.

The MVP of this project is to support basic CRUD operations on a single table. The following is a list features that are already implemented or are planned to be implemented.

Legend:

- üìù: Planned
- üèóÔ∏è: In Progress
- ‚úÖ: Done

For more details please check the source code and the test files.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -D type-safe-sql-query

# or
yarn add -D type-safe-sql-query

# or
pnpm add -D type-safe-sql-query
```

## Basic Usage

The following examples demonstrates how to use `type-safe-sql-query` with MySQL.

```ts
import type { InferReturnTypeFromSqlStatement, InferParamsTypeFromSqlStatement } from "type-safe-sql-query";
import type { Tables } from "./tables";

type Result = InferReturnTypeFromSqlStatement<"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND age > ?", Tables>;
// Result is: { id: number, name: string, age: number, email: string }[]

type Params = InferParamsTypeFromSqlStatement<"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND age > ?", Tables>;
// Params is: [string, number]

type ResultWithAlias = InferReturnTypeFromSqlStatement<"SELECT name AS fullName, age FROM Users", Tables>;
// ResultWithAlias is: { fullName: string, age: number }[]
```

The examples above assumes that we have a file called `tables.ts` that contains the type information of our database tables. This file should be auto-generated with [schemats](https://github.com/sweetiq/schemats) for example.

```ts
// tables.ts (auto-generated with schemats)

export type Tables = {
  users: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    age: number;
    email: string;
  };
  // ...
};
```

### Usage with Low Level Database Drivers

The following example demonstrates how to use `type-safe-sql-query` with the [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver.

```ts
import mysql from "mysql2/promise";
import type { InferParamsTypeFromSqlStatement, InferParamsFromSqlStatement } from "type-safe-sql-query";
import type { Tables } from "./tables";

// Create the connection to database
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  user: "root",
  database: "test",
});

// Create a type-safe query wrapper
async function query<S extends string>(
  sql: S,
  params: InferParamsTypeFromSqlStatement<S, Tables>,
): InferReturnTypeFromSqlStatement<S, Tables> {
  const [results] = await connection.query(sql, params);
  return results as any;
}

// Use the type-safe query wrapper to query the database.
const users = await query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND age > ?", ["Michael", 36]);
```

Other low level database drivers like [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql), [postgres](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) or [pg](https://node-postgres.com/) should work similarly.
